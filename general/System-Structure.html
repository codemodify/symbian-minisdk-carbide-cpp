<h4>(o) Kernel</h4>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">- the code that
runs the OS on a CPU.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the data used to track how things are running.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - implements the operating system's design model.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Types of
the kernel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - monolithic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Provide all
OS functions and hardware abstraction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - micro kernel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Provide a
small set of system functions and hardware models.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The rest is
provided by server apps, that run outside of mikrokernel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - hybrid kernel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A mikrokernel
with some of the special functions that usually are provided <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by
servers - incorporated in the kernel
for performance reasons.<br>

<h4>(o) Interrupts</h4>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Current systems are build from devices that through their controllers
communicate with each-other</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
over a BUS. In order to communicate they need to compete for the BUS
access. In a BUSed system the</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CPU must be the primary controlling source. Thus across the BUS there
is a hierarchy of device </span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
priorities, and a set of rules to work with the priority system. Any
device controller can</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
communicate with any other device controller sharing the BUS, but their
'talk' can be </span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pre-emptied (interrupted) by other device controller with higher
priorities.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A BUS based system is driven by "interrupts" - understoodable as - "a
ring of a telephone" -</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
meaning an event that is designed to get attention of the hardware or
software.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in this preordered chaos, a device can
rise(emit,signal) and interrupt and draw the CPU's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attention. In this case it will save what it was
doing, and get to the device to solve his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem. It will return to the saved work after the
interrupt was served.<br>
<br style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device communication is based around this interrupt
approach which is using a set(many) of interrupt</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
types. Each interrupt is served by a </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">I</span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">nterrupt </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">S</span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">ervice </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">R</span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">outine. A list
of pointers to each ISR for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each interrupt type is kept in the system.
Interrupts have their own priority system of executing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The OSes are interrupt driven. They do very little
one their own. Mostly they wait for an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interrupt to occur, to be able to do varied tasks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating systems have many services to be used, but
they propose these services on request only.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus operating systems offer their own system of
software-interrupts, implemented as sys-calls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it catches a request to 'interrupt' from what
it was doing and move the attention elsewhere,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it saves the state of current operation, and moves
to routine that corresponds to the syscall.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here we see that the OS is just a CPU
implemented in software, that implements its operations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from smaller operations that resembles its
own(generalized).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (like incomming call) during the message sending

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is not for what an OS is created. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of communication method is called -
synchronous communication - and it is adequate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a real-time communication. <br>
</span></span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 51);"><span

 style="font-weight: bold;">(B)</span> - </span></span><span
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">The real-time behaviour is a part of
current modern OSes - meaning that a general purpose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OS is asynchronous by its behaviour - applicaitons
and OS can continue while waiting for an <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I/O to finish. In example (B) the hardawre signals
when the transfer has begun, and signals when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tranfer finishes and the results for an I/O are
ready.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The a-synchronous deive I/O means that the OS must
keep track of the state of the devices.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the OS is going
to "get back" to handle a device after it has serviced a request, it
must</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'write down'
somewhere what was happening with the device when last time it was
working with it.<br>
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This "record-keeping" activity is the very
important one and is the one that keeps and OS busy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most of the time, and that takes lots of memory
needed to run an OS.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To minimize the OS involvement in servicing an I/O
request and correspondengly system resouces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; needed for this(CPU time, memory sapce) - more I/O
can be placed on the device by adding more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interrupts to enable communication. The device could
do all the operations by itself - and only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filling in a speciffic area in the shared memory
with the result data. This way the OS gets <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involved only everything is ready, by being
signaled(interupt) by the device.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This method of the I/O is called DMA - direct memory
access - meaning that the device has access<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to an area in the memory that nobody crosses except
the OS(reading) and the hardware device(writting).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With DMA the OS becomes less resource hungry and
very responsive and speedy. DMA is a form of <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asynchrounous I/O, but it differs from "general </span></span><span
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">asynchrounous idea".<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asynchrounous I/O - is fine-grained - it siganls the
CPU even when there are small amounts of <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data to transfer. DMA - is coarse-grained - assigns
all the data tranfer to the device. The OS <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; satrts the IO and gets notified when it is done.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can differentiate 3 types of device communication:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o)- synchronous<br>
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; ex: a handheld linux device that plays video is likely to
work in real-time with the video driver</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the operating system.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o)- a</span></span><span
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">synchronous<br>
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; ex: computers with windowing system use </span></span></span><span
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 204);"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">a</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">synchronous I/O to monitor GUI devices
like mouse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the mouse moves
it generates an interrupt that cause the OS to read mouse events.<br>
</span></span><span
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o)- DMA<br>
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; ex: computers use DMA for large I/O tasks - like reading
from a disk-drive. It is enough </span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for an OS to send a read-block-of-data
command, and can 'relax' to be notified when</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the buffer data is ready. (The data
might be very big, so if the DMA was not present here</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; then even with an async-IO the task
would slow down the OS and its responsiveness.)</span><br

<h4>(o) Storage structures:</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another essential component is the ability to
store/stock/remember data for later to be able<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to refet to it. Data being: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - current states of the devices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - application related states like
- stack, heap, instruction to be executed etc...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - any dynamic data that be needed
to run an OS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The core computing-cycle known also as
'fetch-execute' cycle, is very dependent on the storage.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It fetches an instruction from memory(<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">storage</span>), puts it in a register(<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">more storage</span>), excutes that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instruction by possibly fetching more information(<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">more storage</span>) and stores the result
of execution<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in memory(<span style="font-weight: bold;">even more
storage</span>). <span
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Note: this
basic computing cycle is part of the design developed by</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
John von Neumann - who built it into a larger computing system based on
a sequential computer memory.<br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
storage mechanism can be viewed as an hierarchy because it permits to
understand their relationship.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each layer of storage is way to extend the upper
level, to give it more space for execution. The drawback<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is that as walk down the hierarchy the speed access
decreses. <br>

cache controller takes care of the writting and free the CPU for other
operations. Cache memory is volatile and are a temporary storage.<br>
            <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-style: italic;">'Cache'
- approach was developed to shield devices from slow data access -
which will result in
slow device activity if no cache is present. Thus cahce-management is
an important issue. For ex: if
cache is full and the CPU needs to write more data to it, then some
data in the cache is overwritten. If
the cache is managed carefully then the relevant data is kept in the
cahce and the new data is written to
the main-memory. The idea of - careful management - is dependent on the
OS.</span></small><br>

<h4>(o) Hardware Access and Protection
</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing computer resources means they can be used
more efficiently and more completely. To the applications<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it appears (the OS makes the illusion) that they are
the only one who uses that resource.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of sharing, the OS is just another
program that competes for the resource. But the difference<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is that it has a bit more priveleges - this is
because it has to manage the rest of the programs and itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So while doing this sharing, managing apps and
itself - there were developped different protection mechanisms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that allow a 'safe existence and running' of all
that a computer can give.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's consider how protection is addressed in OS
desing. We must think how to protect programs from each other,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and how to protect resources like CPU and
memory(cahce,RAM,virtual). The protection is not related to only allow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an organized access to these resources, but also to
keep malicious code from accessing resources in ways that <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could affect the operations or state of other
programs or the whole system.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Protection
modes</span> - protecting programs from each other includes protecting
OS from other programs. In order to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; achieve this it was developed ways to
operate within the system. The OS needs a <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">'privileged mode'</span>,
other <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; programs need a <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">'user mode'</span>.
User-mode is restricted to tasks that a program may perform -
arithmetical <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; computation, executing statements in
program code. Privileged-mode allows a program to execute tasks that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; only the OS should do - working with
devices or managing which program should be run.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Managing operation-modes fast and
efectively will require an implication from hardware side. Most hardware<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; architectures include few operation
modes. This is implemented by a set of mode-bits to indicate the current<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; operation mode. Also there are a set of
priviliged-instructions that only a priviliged program may execute - <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; for this kind of instructions the
hardware forces the checking of mode-bits.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When a usual program needs to do a
privileged mode operation, it asks the OS to do it by calling a
corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; syscall() defined by the OS.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Protecting
Memory</span> - <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - we must guard a program from changing
the memory from another program<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - this is done in cooperation with the
harware - when a program is running the OS sets 2 registers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; a) a base register - holds the
lowest address that can be used by the code.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; b) a limit register - holds the
number of memory addresses that can be addressed by the code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Setting these registers is done by the
OS only(priveleged instructions) and is a part of the process<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; to work to share the CPU.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protecting the
CPU - </span>all the apps that run at the same time on a computer
share the CPU, this includes the OS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Protecting the CPU means we must ensure
that the control is always returned back to the OS from a program,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; even if that is a buggy program that
does not respond. If this is not ensured then we have data loss.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ex: If this happens on a mobile phone while a conversation
is taking place, then the conversation will freeze.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or if a system code would had a bug
that caused user code to run priveleged instructions that would write</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to protected memory and corrupt system
tables or any other critical data.<br>
<br style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There have been developed ways
to protect the CPU from malicious code:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - use a timer to cause a
interrupt to transfer the control back to the OS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The timer is set
when the code starts using the CPU, and is interruped when the amount
of time has elapsed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Timers can be of a
fixed length, or can be of a variable length - this is done in the OS
design. A timer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; interrupt can
happen at any time, even at inconvenient times - when syscall() is made
and interrupting the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; kernel from a
system call service.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - combine the variable
timer usage with control concept of processor sharing. This idea
permits an OS to <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implement
concepts of process management, including the time slices and context
switching.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The duties done by OS based on timers
are very complex: at each context switch the timer for the process must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; be reset for the next execution. If the
timer is a variable timer, then the new value is derived for the next<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; program' time slice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Communication
Structures -</span> The fourth component of a modern computer is
communication.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The structures that have been developed
to handle the communication issues, resemble those that <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; address the I/O. Communication is a
special case of I/O, and thus a special attention and specialized<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; APIs and OS structures has been
allocated to this area. Some OSes like Symbian - have been designed
around <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the communication issues.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At lowest level the communication is
binary data moving through the phisical devices connected to the
computer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; An OS can take a variety of approaches
to implement device I/O and to expose those I/O interface to other APIs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; On top of the physical I/O device, OSes
implement an interface between the software and hardware - they are <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; called "drivers" - or device drivers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; On top of the drivers the OS places a
layer that allows users to use hardware through the priveleged kernel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; instructions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Real examples:</h4>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
OS/360 and MVS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A line of mainframes from IBM. The hardware was
developed ahead before the OSes were to run <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on them. Thus the hardware existed while programmers
were trying to get an OS that made that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hardware useful to run.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) The first version of OS/360 was the simpliest:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sequential scheduler - <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">PCP</span>(primary control prorgam) - it
performed one task at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a time. The control was resturned
to the OS when a program was done. The I/O was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; synchronous.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) Next version of OS/360 introduced
multiprogramming with a fixed number of tasks (MFT).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">MFT
</span>could run up to 15 tasks at once and could reschedule tasks
while they were waiting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for synchronoud IO to finish.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) Last version of OS/360 allowed a variable number
of tasks to be run at concurently.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multitasking with a variable
number of tasks (<span style="font-weight: bold;">MVT</span>) also
supported rescheduling for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; synchronous-I/O-related tasks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) A new version of operating system - SVS (single
virtual storage) was developed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SVS implemented multitasking, but
forced all processes to occupy the same memory sapce.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context swiching was expensive
but memory protection was simple. The only memory that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could be violated is the OS's
memory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) The most popular version of the OS is the - <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">MVS </span>(multiple virtual storage).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVS puts each process in its own
address space, allowing memory to grow as needed by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adding virtual memory on the
disk. Memory protection was more complicated - because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process memory was moved in and
out of physical memory, and because multiple applications<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could be resident in memoryat the
same time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVS idea was inherited in
implementations lilke: OS/370 and OS/390 for various incarnations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of IBM mainframes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Unix and Linux<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unix evolved from MULTICS and used many of its
ideas. The character of the UNIX has a very loosely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connected feel: all of its components build on each
other through use of APIs and its approach to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to software design is to build the OS by
interconnecting simplier tools.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) monolitic kernel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) unix is multitasking with mutlithreading support<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) devices are implemetned as files<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) uses virtual memory and memory mapping to avoid
processes from accessing data of other processes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) supports many file systems and communication
methods through the usage of dynamically lodable modules.<br>
<br>
<br>
Symbian OS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unique in ins existence since it was desgined with
the idea for smartphone usage.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically it comes from: SIBO -&gt; EPOC -&gt;
Symbian.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) microkernel design - minimal system functions
and data are in the kernel with many system<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; functions spread out into the
user space servers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) supports the use of virtual machines: the
implementation of a computer inside a computer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The implementation of Java
language and Java run-time needed to run Java is done using this
mechanism.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) Communication structures in Symbian are easyly
extended. Modules can be written to implement anything,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from UI to the new protocol
implementations to new device drivers. Because of the microkernel design<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these new modules can be
introduced and loaded dynamically.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) Designed at its core with the APIs specialized
for multimedia. Multimedia devices and content are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handled by special APIs and by a
framework that lets the user descrive new and existing content, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what to do with it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) object oriented - syscalls involve system or
kernel side objects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) multitasking with multithreading support.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) FAT32 - file system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) no virtual memory is implemented because of its
smartphone orientation where no disk storage exists.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) pluggable message architecture - one where new
message types can be invented and implemented<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by developing modules that are
dynamically loaded by messaging server.<br>
