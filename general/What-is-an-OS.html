<h2>...What is an OS</h2>
- layer that abstracts the hardware.<br>
- a model of how to deal with the resources on a computer.<br>
- software must use this model to work with the resources.<br>
- focuses on providing ways to work with the hardware.<br>
<br>
A good <span style="text-decoration: underline;">system model</span>
is one that effectively and transparently <br>
provides software with intuitive ways to access system resources.<br>
<br>
Depending on how an OS allows the access to the resources <br>
- using abstraction approach through objects to identify resources, <br>
- or a more direct access from software side <br>
this defines the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">character
of an operating</span> system. That character will evolve<br>
over time as the OS incorporates new technologies.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parameters that define a good
OS:</span><br>
(o) robustness - reliable and tolerates problems well - provides
software services, unless harware fails.<br>
(o) scalability - incorporates resources as they are added to the
system.<br>
(o) extensibility - designed to adapt to new technologies that extend
the OS beyound the point when it was implemented.<br>
(o) throughput - (work that a CPU can complete in a speciffic time
period) - must perform well and achieve high throughput. Must minimize
the time spent providing services while maximizing throughput.<br>
(o) portability - able to run the same OS philosophy on different
hardware.<br>
(o) security - provide inherent securtity. Must prevent unauthorized
users or process from accessing stored data or system services.<br>
