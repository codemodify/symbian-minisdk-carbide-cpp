      <td style="vertical-align: top;">This is the general structure of
the Symbian OS's kernel layers.<br>
The inner layers have the most priveleges that can access anything at
any time they need. They are the most basic actions and very fast. As
you move from inner to outer direcction, the layers start to decrease
in privelege and posibilities to access stuff - this is because they
don't need to.<br>
      <br>

functions.<br>
Simple threads operating in priveleged mode imeplement services that
are very primitive:<br>
- shceduling<br>
- synchronization operations<br>
- synchronization object( mutexes, semaphores )<br>
- interrupt handling<br>
            <br>
Most of the functions at this level can be pre-emted. All the functions
also are very primitive - for performance reasons - and they don't do
any complicated operations like dynamic memory allocations.<br>

functions needed by the rest of OS.<br>
All the operations at this level are priveleged operations. They
combine the functionality from nanokernel to provide more complex tasks:<br>
- complex object services<br>
- user-mode threads<br>
- process scheduling<br>
- context switching<br>
- dynamic memory allocation<br>
- dynamically loads libraries<br>
- complex synchronization objects<br>
- interprocess communication<br>
            <br>
This level is fully pre-emptible and interrupt can cause this layer to
reschedule any parts of its execution - even in the middle of the
context switching.<br>

functionality like:<br>
- handling the display<br>
- working with sockets<br>

<h4>Active Kernel Components <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are parts of the kernel that continously execute
along with other processes in the OS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These kernel processes have higher priorities and
high levels of protection. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are multithreaded to allow for multiple threads
of access from threads <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of execution in various processes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are active because they need to be able to
monitor the system in real-time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they do is:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - handle requests from kernel services.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - load/unload system modules<span
 style="font-style: italic;">(passive kernel components)</span>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - perform all the book-keeping that needs to be done.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - assist with working the passive components<span
 style="font-style: italic;">(as those handle their requests)</span> -
by implementing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; requests in kernel mode.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: mon;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span>
<h4>Passive Kernel Components</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are parts of the kernel that do not execute
continously, but are available for execution<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on behalf of service request.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These components are present on the system under
forms of libraries and dyniamically loadable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modules. They contain code that syscalls() and
interrupt service routines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User mode apps can do kernel mode tasks through
these components.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - device drivers - loaded dynamically by some kernel
implementations when a corresponding device<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; is used/attached. In Symbian the device
drivers are themselves broken down into components that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; are loaded individually.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - microkernel servers are usually run when needed
when their services are not used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - passive behaviour sometimes is used to implement
performance. For some microkernels implementations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; servers are started at boot and run with no
shutdown. Because they react only to requests, they don't<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; run often on CPU, so there is no cost except
memory they use to stay in. Symbian implements servers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; in this manner.<br>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<h3>System Calls and the Kernel</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Syscall</span> - interface to allow a
user-mode process to cause a kernel-mode operation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I it a layer between the
application and inner layers of the kernel.<br>
<br>
The advantages:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - layer of abstraction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - increases efficiency and security, by letting
kernel to coordinate with concurent access<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; to resources.<br>
<br>
Syscalls are implemented as a system of software interrupts. Usually it
is implemented with a type <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of hardware instruction that causes a special
interrupt handler to be invoked.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<h3>Interrupt Implementation</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"></div>
Interrupts are designed to have some indication of priority.<br>
This is the way how they are differectiated that one is more important
than another.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Ex:
"keyboard interrupt" and "timer interrupt to pass control back to the
OS from process".</span><br>
