<h2>What is Symbian OS</h2>
Symbian OS is microkernel based operating system explicitly targeted at
several<br>
geenralized platforms.<br>
<br>
It is flexible enough to meet the industry's requirements for
developing a variety<br>
of advanced mobile devices and phones, while allowing manufacturers the
oportunity<br>
to differentiate their products.<br>
<br>
It was also decided that Symbian would actively adopt current
state-of-teh-art key<br>
technologies as they become available. This decision reinforced the
design choices<br>
of object oriented and client-server architecture.<br>
