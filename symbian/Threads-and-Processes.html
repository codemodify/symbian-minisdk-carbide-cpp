<h2>Threads and Processes</h2>
Active objects are preferred to threads for this role<br>
because they were designed specifically to suit the resource-limited
hardware<br>
upon which Symbian OS runs. Multithreaded code has significantly<br>
higher run-time requirements compared to active objects: for example,<br>
a context switch between threads may be an order of magnitude slower<br>
than a similar switch between active objects running in the same thread.<br>
Threads tend to have a larger size overhead too, typically requiring 4
KB<br>
kernel-side and 8 KB user-side for the program stack, compared to active<br>
objects, which generally occupy only the size of the C++ object (often<br>
less than 1 KB).<br>
<br>
One of the main differences between multitasking with threads and<br>
active objects is the way in which they are scheduled. Active objects<br>
multitask cooperatively within a thread and, once handling an event,<br>
an active object cannot be pre-empted by the active scheduler in<br>
which it runs. Threads on Symbian OS are scheduled pre-emptively<br>
by the kernel.<br>
<br>
On Symbian OS, the class used to manipulate threads is RThread.<br>
An object of type RThread represents a handle to a thread, because <br>
the thread itself is a kernel object.<br>
