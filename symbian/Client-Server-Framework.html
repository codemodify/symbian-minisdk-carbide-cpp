When programming for Symbian OS, it is likely that you will often use
system <br>
servers transparently, via classes that wrap the actual details of
client&#8211;server <br>
communication.<br>
<br>
On Symbian OS, servers are typically used to manage shared access<br>
to system resources and services. The use of a server is efficient
since it<br>
can service multiple client sessions and can be accessed concurrently by<br>
clients running in separate threads.<br>
<br>
A server also protects the integrity of the system because it can ensure<br>
that resources are shared properly between clients, and that all clients<br>
use the resources correctly.<br>
<br>
By employing a server in a separate process, the system can guarantee<br>
that misbehaved clients cannot corrupt any of the resources the server<br>
manages on its behalf or for other clients.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Classes to use to do the talking with
a server:</span><br>
&#8226; RSessionBase &#8211; the client-side base class, representing a session
with a server.<br>
&#8226; RMessage &#8211; a server-side representation of a client request and its
request payload data.<br>
&#8226; DSession &#8211; a kernel class that represents a client&#8211;server session.<br>
&#8226; CSharableSession &#8211; an abstract base class for a server-side
representation of a session.<br>
&#8226; CServer &#8211; an abstract base class, deriving from CActive, which is
used server-side to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; receive client requests from the
kernel and direct them to the appropriate session.<br>
