<h2>Active Objects and Event-driven Multitasking</h2>
<br>
Active objects are a fundamental part of Symbian OS.<br>
They are designed for responsive and efficient event handling.<br>
<br>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Before explaining active objects,
let&#8217;s consider how code actually &#8221;runs&#8221;.</span></h4>
A thread is a fundamental unit of execution, which runs within a
process.<br>
A process has its own address space and may have one or more threads
independently <br>
executing code within it. When a process is created, a single primary
thread is <br>
initialized within it. Other threads may then be created. Code
executing in that<br>
process accesses "virtual memory addresses" which are mapped for that
process to <br>
physical locations in hardware by the memory management unit. <br>
The writable memory of one process is not normally accessible to
another process, <br>
thus &#8221;protecting&#8221; processes from each other. However, multiple threads
running in <br>
the same process are not isolated from each other in the same way
because they share <br>
the memory mapped for the process in which they run. This means that
they can access each<br>
other&#8217;s data, which is useful, but they can also accidentally scribble
on it, which is not.<br>
<br>
On Symbian OS, threads are scheduled pre-emptively by the kernel.<br>
Each thread may be suspended while waiting for a given event to occur
and may resume <br>
whenever appropriate. The kernel controls thread scheduling, allowing
the threads to <br>
share the system resources by time-slice division, preempting the
running of a thread <br>
if another, higher priority thread becomes eligible to run. This
constant switching of <br>
the running thread is the basis of <span style="font-weight: bold;">pre-emptive
multitasking</span>, which allows multiple <br>
servers and applications to run simultaneously. A context switch occurs
when the <br>
currently running thread is suspended <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">(for example, if it is
blocked, has reached</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">the end of its
time-slice, or a higher priority thread becomes ready to </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">run)</span> and another
<br>
thread is made current by the scheduler. The context switch incurs a
runtime overhead <br>
in terms of the kernel scheduler and, potentially, the memory
management unit and <br>
hardware caches, if the original and replacing threads are executing in
different processes.<br>
<br>
On hardware running Symbian OS, resources are more limited than on a
typical desktop PC. <br>
Thus, on Symbian OS, besides the requirements to be responsive and
handle power consumption <br>
carefully, it is also important that the memory used by event-handling
code is minimized and <br>
that processor resources are used efficiently. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Active objects </span>assist with
efficient programming <br>
by providing a model for lightweight, event-driven multitasking.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Active objects</span> encapsulate the
traditional wait loop inside a class. They were designed such <br>
that a switch between active objects that run in the same thread incurs
a lower overhead than <br>
a thread context switch. This makes active objects preferable for
event-driven multitasking on<br>
Symbian OS.<br>
<br>
On Symbian OS, active objects multitask cooperatively and,
consequently, there is no need for <br>
synchronization protection of shared resources. In addition, because
active objects run in the <br>
same thread, memory and objects may be shared more readily.<br>
<br>
On Symbian OS, the use of active objects for event-handling
multitasking is ideal because they <br>
are designed for efficiency and responsiveness. In general, a Symbian
OS application or server <br>
will consist of a single main event-handling thread. A set of active
objects run in the thread, <br>
each representing a task. Each active object requests an asynchronous
service, waits while it <br>
is serviced, handles the request completion event and communicates with
other tasks as necessary.<br>
<br>
Some events require a response within a guaranteed time, regardless of
any other activity in the <br>
system. This is called &#8221;real-time&#8221; event-handling. For example, a
real-time task may be required <br>
to keep the buffer of a sound driver supplied with sound data &#8211; a delay
in response delays the<br>
sound decoding, which results in it breaking up. Other typical
real-time requirements may be <br>
even more strict, say for low-level telephony. These tasks have, in
effect, different requirements <br>
for real-time responses, which can be represented by task priorities.
Higher-priority tasks must <br>
always be able to <span style="font-weight: bold;">"pre-empt"</span>
lower-priority tasks in order to guarantee to meet their real-time <br>
requirements. The shorter the response time required, the higher the
priority that should be <br>
assigned to a task.<br>
<br>
However, once an active object is handling an event, it may not be
pre-empted by the event <br>
handler of another active object, which means that they are not
suitable for real-time tasks.<br>
On Symbian OS, real-time tasks should be implemented using
high-priority threads and processes, <br>
with the priorities chosen as appropriate for relative real-time
requirements.<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Active
objects are used on Symbian OS to simplify asynchronous programming and
make it <br>
easy for you to write code to submit asynchronous requests, manage
their completion events <br>
and process the result. They are well suited for lightweight
event-driven programming,</span><br
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">except
where a real-time, guaranteed response is required.</span><br

<h4>How Active Objects work<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></h4>
A typical Symbian OS application or server consists of a single
event-handling thread <br>
running a scheduler (the &#8221;active scheduler&#8221;) which coordinates one or
more active objects. <br>
Each active object requests an asynchronous service and handles the
resulting completion <br>
event some time after the request. It also provides a way to cancel an
outstanding request <br>
and may provide error handling for exceptional conditions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>How to work with Active Objects</h4>
An active object class must derive from class CActive, which is defined
in "e32base.h" .<br>
-A derivate from this class must call "CActiveScheduler::Add()" in its
constructor,<br>
&nbsp;to be added to the active scheduler.<br>
-A derivate from this class must implement RunL() in oder to be able to
handle events.<br>
-A derivate from this class must always call Cancel() in the destructor
to terminate any<br>
outstanding requests.<br>
<br>
Here are the most importand methods.<br>

<h4>Threads Without an Active Scheduler</h4>
Most threads running on Symbian OS have an active scheduler, which is
usually created <br>
implicitly by a framework (e.g. CONE for the GUI framework). However,
if you are <br>
implementing a server, you have to create and start an active scheduler
explicitly <br>
before you can use active objects. Likewise, console-based test code
may not use active <br>
objects directly itself, but must create an active scheduler in its
main thread if it<br>
depends on components which do use active objects.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>More details on Active Objects</h2>
Here about the responsibilities of active objects, asynchronous service
providers and the active scheduler <br>
and hoe they fit together.<br>
<br>
(o) Symbian OS event-handling is usually managed in one thread, which
runs a single active scheduler.<br>
(o) The active scheduler holds a set of active objects for that thread,
each of which encapsulates <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an associated asynchronous service provider.<br>
(o) Each thread has an associated request semaphore; when an
asynchronous function completes, it <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generates an event by calling "RequestComplete()" on
the requesting thread, which signals its<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; semaphore and is detected by the active scheduler.<br>
(o) The active scheduler calls the "RunL()" event handler method of the
active object associated <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the completion event.<br>
<br>
Active obect encapsulates asynchronous functions. Asynchronous
functions can be identified as those <br>
taking a <span style="font-weight: bold;">"TRequestStatus"</span>
reference parameter into which the request completion status is posted.<br>
An object implementing such methods is usually known as an <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">asynchronous service provider</span>.<br>
<br>
A typical active object class provides public &#8221;request issuing&#8221; methods
for its clients to <br>
submit asynchronous requests. These pass on the requests to the
encapsulated asynchronous service <br>
provider, passing by reference the <span style="font-weight: bold;">iStatus</span>
member variable of the CActive class as the <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TRequestStatus</span> parameter.
Having issued the request, the issuer method must call <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CActive::SetActive()</span><br>
to set the <span style="font-weight: bold;">iActive </span>member to
indicate that there is an outstanding request.<br>
<br>
The service provider must set the value of the incoming TRequestStatus
to KRequestPending (=0x80000001) <br>
before acting on the request. Upon completion, if the service provider
is in the same thread as the <br>
requester, it calls User::RequestComplete(), passing the TRequestStatus
and a completion result, <br>
typically one of the standard errors such as KErrNone or KErrNotFound,
to indicate the success<br>
or otherwise of the request. User::RequestComplete() sets the value of
TRequestStatus and generates <br>
a completion event in the requesting thread by signaling the thread&#8217;s
request semaphore. If the<br>
asynchronous service provider and the requester are in separate
threads, the service provider must <br>
use an RThread object, representing a handle to the requesting thread,
to complete the request. <br>
It should call RThread::RequestComplete() to post the completion code
and notify the request semaphore.<br>
<br>
While the request is outstanding, the requesting thread runs in the
active scheduler&#8217;s event <br>
processing loop. When it is not handling completion events, the active
scheduler suspends <br>
the thread by calling User::WaitForAnyRequest(), which waits on a
signal to the thread&#8217;s request <br>
semaphore. When the asynchronous service provider completes a request,
it signals the semaphore <br>
of the requesting thread as described above, and the active scheduler
determines which active<br>
object should handle the completed request. It uses its
priority-ordered list of active objects, <br>
inspecting each one in turn to determine whether it has a request
outstanding. It does so by <br>
checking the iActive flag; if the object does indeed have an
outstanding request, it then inspects<br>
its TRequestStatus member variable to see if it is set to a value other
than KRequestPending. <br>
If so, this indicates that the active object is associated with a
request that has completed <br>
and that its event handler code should be called. Having found a
suitable active object, <br>
the active scheduler clears the active object&#8217;s iActive flag and calls
its RunL() event handler.<br>
This method handles the event and may, for example, resubmit a request
or generate an event <br>
on another object in the system. While this method is running, other
events may be generated but <br>
RunL() is not pre-empted &#8211; itruns to completion before the active
scheduler resumes control and<br>
determines whether any other requests have completed. Once the RunL()
call has finished, the <br>
active scheduler re-enters the event processing wait loop by issuing
another <br>
User::WaitForAnyRequest() call. This checks the request semaphore and
either suspends the thread <br>
(if no other requests have completed in the meantime) or returns
immediately (if the semaphore <br>
indicates that other events were generated while the previous event
handler was running) so the <br>
scheduler can repeat active object lookup and event handling.<br>

lookup and event-handling. It</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
