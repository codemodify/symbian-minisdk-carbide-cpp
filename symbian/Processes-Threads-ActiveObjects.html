<h2>Processes<br>
</h2>
Process - a program in state of execution. It becomes the center of
system that shares the CPU and grants<br>
access to all programs that need it.<br>
<br>
Process is made up of:<br>
- text section - the code that executes.<br>
- data section - variables used in the code.<br>
- state of the other hardware components that the program needs to run:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) program counter(aka IP-instruction pointer) -
holds the address of the instruction being executed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) temporary registers - used to execute process'
instructions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (o) program stack - contains data required to run
the program - from a programming language they are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameters, return addresses,
local variables.<br>
- state of the other hardware components taht the program was written
to work with.<br>

<h2>Threads</h2>
One of the components of the process is the "thread of control" - the
set of instructions being executed<br>
on behalf of the program. This thread is orchestrated by the program
counter and represents an executing program.<br>
<br>
If to consider that the program has many threads of control - the PCB
remains the same. One memory space, one set of accounting information,
etc...<br>
<br>
Now giving the fact that a program withing a single structure can run
multiple tasks, we get the fact that threads are very welcome on a
system because they do not require context switching - and thus have
the potential of executing much faster than two processes doing the
same tasks as the threads would do.<br>
<br>
Such a system is called multithreading.<br>
Benefits of multithreading:<br>
- sharing of resources: memory space, system resources, code - of the
process they belong.<br>
- saving resources: expensive and time consuming allocations of new
resources is not needed for each thread.<br>
- interacting with user: background and blocking operations can be done
in threads.<br>
- accessing multiple processors: if there are many CPUs, a
multithreaded app can take advantage of this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align: right;">User and Kernel threads</h4>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">A multithreaded app is composed
of user threads. These threads run on behalf of a process, which itself<br>
runs in user mode. Threads that run in user mode at user level, consume
user resources and interact with<br>
the system at user level.&nbsp;&nbsp; The kernel is not needed till
syscalls() are made.<br>
<br>
If an OS supports user-level-multithreading, the threading of the
kernel affects how multithreaded apps<br>
execute.<br>
<br>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img
 style="width: 390px; height: 294px;" alt="" src="resources/threads.PNG"><br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Single
Threaded kernels (A)<br>
      </span>Called many-to-one kernel threading model. Many user
threads compete for a single kernel thread of kernel control. The
result is lots of waiting in the user threads. In this model user
threads still get some benefit, but when interacting with the kernel
there is no benefit. To not oeverflow the system with requests from
threads, some systems of this kernel threading model(ex: Windows NT)
put a max limit on the user threads that can run at the same time. In
this model a single thread can block the app if there are many threads
wanting the kernel control.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multithreded Kernel (B)<br>
      </span>Called one-to-one kernel threading model. The kernel
spawns a new thread for each user-thread that makes kernel requests.
This increases concurency and eliminates the block of threads. The
overhead of creating kernel threads can affect the application
performance. For this reason systems with this model(ex: Win2000) put a
max limit on the number of running threads with kernel requests.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multithreaded Kernel (C)</span><br>
Called many-to-many kernel threading model. This model is <br>
working out the problem of overhead in (B) - where the bottle neck is
when it is needed to create/destroy kernel treads for each new
user-thread with kernel requests.<br>
Instead it creates it and keeps it runing, till somebody else will need
to do the requests and an existing one will be used. This model is more
favorable for multi CPU systems. Many UNIXes support this model.<br>

Issues with threads comes when we talk about the process scheduling,
that at this step needs to include<br>
and its threads into account. Basically threads pass through the same
sates as a process does, and here are spent some additional resources
by the scheduler to decide what thread of the process needs to be run.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Active Objects</h2>
Active OBject - is Symbian specialized thread that has some unique
characteristics:<br>
<br>
(o)- each active object is specifically focused on an event that causes
a thread or process to block.<br>
<br>
(o)- each active object works with a single active scheduler that
listens for events for which <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the object is waiting. All active objects
within a process uses the same active shceduler.<br>
<br>
(o)- an active object defines a speciffic entry point in its code, that
is used by the active shceduler,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when an event is generated. The entry point is
function call with a known prototype.<br>
<br>
(o)- while waiting for an event, all active objects in a process act as
a single thread to the system -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because they are maintained by the same
shceduler. <br>
<br>
So active objects are a lighter version of threads and a way to
implement multi threading, because they all within an application
represent a thread - thus no additional resources would be spent as in
case for many threads present in an app.<br>
<br>
The basic idea is that if you have an Active Object defined in your
app, then your app will have at least 2 threads: one main , one for the
active scheduler.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Symbian favors and is build around the thread concept. A process is
taken as a collection of threads with<br>
one single PCB and memory space.<br>
<br>
Threading support in Symbian is based on the nanokernel with
nanothreads.<br>
Nanokernel provides nanothread-shceduling, synchronization, timing
services.<br>
Nanothreads run in priveleged mode and need a stack to store runtime
data.<br>
Nanothreads have thread states as the normal process have, but it adds
few more:<br>
(o)- suspended - different than waiting - it is blocked by some upper
level object ex: Symbian OS thread.<br>
(o)- fastSemaphoreWait - waiting for a fast semaphore to be signaled<br>
(o)- DFC Wait - waiting for a delayed function call(DFC)to be added to
the DFC queue; DFC implements an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interrupt system in Symbian, allowing a
function call to be processed after a interrupt has been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; processed.<br>
(o)- sleeping - waits for a speciffic amount of time.<br>
(o)- other - generic state, used when developers implement custom
states for nanothreads to extend the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nanokernel for new platforms( called
personality layer ).<br>
